      <p>This document attempts to examine the impact of climate change on coastal areas in the northeastern United States. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has a direct impact on oceanic warming and hurricane formation. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall as a powerful tropical storm, severely damaging the Jersey Shore. Homes were destroyed by high winds, water, and storm surges.</p>
      <p>The storm stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, hitting areas that would normally be safe from hurricane impacts.

          <li>$30 to $50 billion dollars in damages</li>
          <li>Damage to both public and private property including coastline.</li>

      <p>A literature review shows the history of hurricane and tropical storm categories that have made landfall in the northeast. So-called "storms of the century" are becoming more common and increasingly destructive. This is paired with the 420ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere that we have now reached, the highest amount of CO2 that humans have ever lived with.

  function greetMe(yourName) {

    alert("Hello " + yourName);
  
  }
  
  greetMe("World");
        </code>
      </p>
  <p>
     The impacts of high CO2 range from ocean acidification, ocean warming, glacial melting, and greater evaporation leading to stronger storms over the Atlantic Ocean. The ingredients for a hurricane are simple and only require water and warmth.

      <p>YWe have created a spreadsheet indicating the categories of the storms as well as their economic impact alongside the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere at the time. Formulas were added to show correlations represented in the appendix Figure 1-A. </p>
      <p>We have not been able to include data that incorporates natural climate events in the Pacific basin, including the El Nino phenomenon. However, this phenomenon is clearly understood and incorporated into climate warming projections. 
</p>
      <p>Due to many environmental factors, it can be difficult to properly assess economic impacts as well as those brought upon human health.</p>

        Generally, the strength and impacts of these hurricanes has increased with the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere. Hurricanes and their various impacts can be tracked by the following metrics: 

        <ul>
          <li>Storm surge
              <li>Windspeed</li>
              <li>Floodwater levels</li>
              <li>Economic impacts</li>
            </ul>
      </p>

      <p>From our research, all of the aforementioned indicators were much higher given the strengths of the storms. The economic loss associated with Hurricane Sandy is between $30 to $50 billion. The large range of this estimate highlights weaknesses in the data collection process.</p>

      <p>
        We can conclude that greater CO2 levels will lead to more powerful storms in the Atlantic Ocean and the world. Typhoons in the eastern hemisphere can potentially become more devastating, leading to crop destruction and food supply shortages.

      <p>
        It should be the collective mission of governments across the globe to mitigate CO2 emissions to safe levels. Anthropogenic climate change is supported science, and despite Earth's natural climate cycles, the rate and severity of our current warming situation leaves much room for improvement.

        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed.
        To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                <code>
  if (condition_1) {
            
    statement_1;

  } else if (condition_2) {
    
    statement_2;
    
  } else if (condition_n) {
  
    statement_n;
  
  } else {
  
    statement_last;
  
  } 
        </code>

        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
        confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>
  if (x = y) { 
    
    /* statements here */
  
  }
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
        parentheses around the assignment. For example:
        <code>
  if ((x = y)) {
  
    /* statements here */
  
  }
        </code>
      </p>
